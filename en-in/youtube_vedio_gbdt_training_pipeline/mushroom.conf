# Tree Booster Parameters
# step size shrinkage
eta = 0.4
# minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition
gamma = 1.0
# minimum sum of instance weight(hessian) needed in a child
min_child_weight = 1
# maximum depth of a tree

# Task Parameters
# the number of round to do boosting
num_round = 30
# 0 means do not save any model except the final round model
